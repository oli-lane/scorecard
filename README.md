A simple interactive 18 hole golf scorecard
Contributers: Oliver Lane and Nick Bircher; Cal Poly CS '25

# Inspiration
Don't you hate creating makeshift scorecards in your Notes app whenever you play Mini Golf?
Wouldn't it be just the perfect solution to have a premade interactive scorecard app instead?

We created just that using the Reactjs framework.

# Features
2 Components: Input Cell & Scoretable
Scoretable is comprised of 2 types of Input Cells: Header Cells and basic Input Cells
useState hook is used for the Input Cell
useCallback hook is used for creating the running total for the Scoretable
Minimal CSS is used as this is a technique project to implement JSX skills.
